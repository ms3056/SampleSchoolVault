> [!NOTE]
> How to make a note - you can automate this in several ways - but creating it manually is OK too. 
> I use an external program call ESPANSO which is free and cross platform to automate this - but it is a little advanced, and not necessary. 
> 
> 1. `[Note]` is what will be displayed as the link for our note
> 2. `(this is the folder structure and name of the note)` 
> `[Notes](CourseNotes/2023/Semester1/CS50/20231023130914)`

The name of the note displayed is up to you. The key will be the property values that the queries will focus on to gather them up.
